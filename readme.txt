Acclectic Media Organizer is a file manager for your media library. Organize your attachments, photos, and other media items into folders, and easily filter items by folder when you add them to posts and pages!

== Description ==

Acclectic Media Organizer creates a virtual file system that lets you better organize attachments and everything in your media library. Simply create folders and subfolders, and then drag and drop items directly within the media library. When you are ready to use attachments in your content, find them easily by selecting their folder. No more sifting through thousands of items to find the right one!

=== Features ===

Create folders and subfolders, just like in a real file system.

Upload new items directly to a folder simply by selecting the folder when you add them to the media library.

Rearrange your folder tree by simply dragging and dropping folders directly within the folder tree.

**Drag & Drop Items**

**Filter Items When Attaching**
See only the items you want when adding attachments to posts and pages by clicking on the appropriate folder in the media browser dialog.

**Multi-Mode Support**
Acclectic Media Organizer works in both List and Grid modes in the Media Library. It is also shown in the media browser dialog when adding attachments.
